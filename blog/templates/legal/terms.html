                    <h4 id="resolving-disputes">9. Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>Users agree to contact DevDiaries to resolve disputes informally. Disputes not resolved
                        informally may be subject to binding arbitration. No class or representative actions are

                    <h4 id="miscellaneous">13. Miscellaneous</h4>
                    <p>DevDiaries may not exercise every right, and failure to enforce a provision doesn’t waive the

                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>Users agree that communications may be conducted electronically. These terms may be updated to
                        reflect changes in services.</p>
